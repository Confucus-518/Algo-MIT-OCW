# Code for "Intro to Algorithms" course from MIT Opencourseware

## Description
This will mainly just be a compilation of the coded out algorithms/data structures/interfaces gone through in the course. I will be using C++ for most as I want to improve my C++ skills, though I may also eventually type out the python equivalents.
Course can be found at https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020

## Aims
* Learn about the basic data structures and algorithms used commonly in CS
* Improve coding skills
* Learn how to solve competitive coding problems (like leetcode)
* Learn about related CS topics, e.g. time efficiency using asymptotic analysis, memory allocation, ...

## DISCLAIMERS!!
* I am currently as of learning, IB Y5 and am doing this out of interest. This is simply my process of learning so do not expect perfect code
* Some of the math is above my level (HL MAA) and I will not be spending too much time looking into those topics
* I use many resources aside from those provided in the course, e.g. ChatGPT ðŸ˜²

## Others
* Feel free to suggest improvements and advice ðŸ˜„
